# MODULE 07: Files & Exceptions        
# ASSIGNMENT 07: Exception Handling & Pickling
 
## 1. Introduction 
This paper documents my learning from Module 7, the goal of which was to learn about creating scripts using custom functions, files and error handling.  We also learned about creating advanced GitHub web pages.   
  
I have demonstrated my learning by  
	• Being able to answer the questions provided in the Assignment  
	• Creating a script that performs this week's task  
	• Running the script within both PyCharm and a command shell  
	• Posting my files on GitHub: https://github.com/seattlethistle/IntroToProg-Python-Mod07  
	• Adding a new GitHub web page to my repository: https://seattlethistle.github.io/IntroToProg-Python-Mod07/  
	• Post my GitHub link to the message board  
	• Peer reviewing another student's files in GitHub and adding my comments to their post  

## 2. Background  	 
I watched the video "Mod07 Course Video" and followed along with the class notes "_Mod7Python ProgrammingNotes.pdf".  I also watched the Session 7 Q&A recording.  Finally I watched the "Starting Assignment 07" video.  
  
I read the seventh chapter of "Python Programming, 3rd Edition" entitled "Files and Exceptions: The Trivia Challenge Game". I'm really enjoying how the book relates each chapter to a game.  
  
There were no additional videos this week however there was a requirement to carry out independent research on both Exception Handling and Pickling.
