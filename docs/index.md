# ASSIGNMENT 07: Exception Handling & Pickling
 
## 1. Introduction
	 
This paper documents my learning from Module 7, the goal of which was to learn about creating scripts using custom functions, files and error handling.  We also learned about creating advanced GitHub web pages.   
  
I have demonstrated my learning by  
	• Being able to answer the questions provided in the Assignment  
	• Creating a script that performs this week's task  
	• Running the script within both PyCharm and a command shell  
	• Posting my files on GitHub  
		https://github.com/seattlethistle/IntroToProg-Python-Mod07  
	• Adding a new GitHub web page to my repository    
		https://seattlethistle.github.io/IntroToProg-Python-Mod07/  
	• Post my GitHub link to the message board  
	• Peer reviewing another student's files in GitHub and adding my comments to their post
